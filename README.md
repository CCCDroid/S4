# S4 - A small and fast stack machine VM

S4 is a system where the code is both human readable source code and the VM's machine code.

The entire system is inplemented one file. The same code runs on both a Windows PC or development board via the Arduino IDE. Since the Ardiono IDE requires a .INO file, there is one additional for for the Arduino IDE.

The reference for S4 is here: https://github.com/CCurl/S4/blob/main/reference.txt

S4 was inspired by STABLE. See https://w3group.de/stable.html for details on STABLE.
A big thanks to Sandor Schneider for the inspiration for this.
